        "About": "<h2>Objective</h2><p>Provide a simple and transparent mechanism for the copyright free sharing and collaborative design of API specifications, interfaces and data models.</p><h2>API Growth and the Challenge of Interfaces</h2><p>Web APIs are fast becoming a critical technology to enable integration between service providers and consumers on the Internet, both in business and public spheres. As the number of APIs increases, so does the potential for innovation in terms of applications on top of these APIs.</p><p>Unfortunately however:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Many APIs provide similar or related functionality but use slightly different Interface patterns, conventions in data models, or otherwise differ in ways often not important for delivery of the API's functionality. This requires fresh code implementations for each and every new API by consumers</li><li>Reuse of existing API Interface specifications and data models is often a legal grey area since there is no clear means for organizations to signal that such specifications are copyright free and available for reuse.</li><li>For APIs which may be re-used, there are rarely uniform service descriptions in machine readable formats such as Swagger, WADL, Google Explorer, or other formats available</li></ul><p>Each of these factors means that as the number of APIs grow, the amount of code needing to be written to interface to them grows as a high multiple of the number of APIs. This is already beginning to lead to a vast amount of wasted work and will be a serious limiting factor in the long term growth and usage of APIs.</p><h2>Establishing an API Interface Commons</h2><p>In order to address these challenges, we propose the establishment of a public \"API Commons\" that enables anybody to declare API Interfaces (Method Patterns, Messages, Data Models and any other related construct) they have authored as reusable, modifiable and shareable by others. The objective is to enable:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Authors of interfaces to declare what is reusable in simple terms.</li><li>Others to adopt reusable interfaces.</li><li>Encourage sharing adaptations back to the public commons.</li></ul><p>We anticipate the benefits of this to be for both individuals/individual organisations and for the growth of APIs as a whole and innovation in general:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>For Individuals / Individual Organisations:<ul class=\"main list\"><li>Shared interfaces will represent a growing resource of well crafted common interfaces.</li><li>Reusing shared interfaces will provide a clear legal status for APIs in use.</li><li>Shared interfaces that see adoption by multiple parties may grow over time to have associated open source server side and/or client libraries.</li><li>Shared interfaces will hopefully over time evolve to represent best practice in a given sector.<li>Donating interfaces to the commons and contributing to common interfaces creates awareness and increases the likelyhood of server and client libraries being written for an API - increasing adoption.</ul></li><li>For API deployment as a whole:<li>Convergence on common interfaces in specific areas will lead to a radical decrease in the amount of fresh code needing to be written to interface to such APIs.</li><li>If successful, the API commons could reduce the amount of distinct interfaces/api definition to be a factor of 10 or even 100 smaller than the number of APIs operating worldwide.</li></ul><h2>Core Activity</h2><p>Bring about the regular sharing of interfaces using clear legal terms for reuse, using the minimum that is needed. We expect this to include devising a means to signal reusability clearly, and ideally the provision of vetted legal copy.</p><h2>Supporting Activity</h2><p>Whilst the items in the above sections are necessary to enable and API Commons, they would only barely be sufficient. Hence in addition to this, the group listed below, also aims to:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Creation of a web registry (and potentially other mechanisms) to locate interfaces in the commons, as well as provide easy to access information on how to declare an interface in the commons and list it.</li><li>Ensure the registry is well structured and includes links to projects associated with different interfaces on Github, the Web or elsewhere which show adoption of each interface and active use.</li><li>Track news about the usage and adoptions of the commons to help adoption and best practice.</li><li>Provide support for conversation around how to adapt and evolve API/service description frameworks to be more modular and composable. (likely through working sessions at industry events).</li></ul><h2>What is \"in\" and what is \"out\"</h2><p>Interface items that are considered part of the commons are: data models, call patterns, interfaces specifications and definitions of any type. Typically the interface commons DOES NOT cover:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Computer code creating the functionality that would be required to IMPLEMENT the server behind such an Interface.</li><li>Computer code creating the functionality that would be required to IMPLEMENT the client or clients for such an Interface.</li></ul><p>On other words, the objective is to ensure re-usability of the INTERFACE DEFINITIONS and is agnostic about the sharing status of implementations of the interface.<p>The implementation / computer code items may be available as \"open source\" under a variety of licenses or as proprietary code, however their provision is outside of the scope of the API Commons. Our conjecture is that existing open source licenses and practice are sufficient to cover these. API Commons may highlight and promote such implementing computer code however where it is known.</p><h2>Principles behind API Commons</h2><p>The objective of the API Commons is to increase sharing and reuse - any activity described here-in is not-for-profit and is open for re-use:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Anybody can declare works they have authored to be in the commons.</li><li>In very narrow cases they may be able to assert the work of others is in the commons (e.g. orphaned copyright).</li><li>API Commons takes no legal position on the legality of any particular declaration, it simply provides guidelines as to how something can be signalled to be in the commons.</li></ul><p>In terms of support activities, while the objective is to provide a registry of work in the commons:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Many such registries could exist.</li><li>Many organisations could promote uptake of the commons.</li><li>Debate on recommendations, support activities etc. shall be open, free and inclusive.</li></ul><h2>Challenges</h2><p>We believe this is a valuable and worthwhile exercise, but that it will also be challenging to establish and encourage such a practice. Challenges include:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>\"Who's first\" problem - creating momentum will be difficult early on.</li><li>Technically it may not be that easy to determine how to reuse a whole definition or parts of one - it is not clear how well existing machine readable formats can be adapted to support this, yet be able to reference which is in use.<li>There may be legal challenges in certain cases.</li><li>Marketing and promotion for awareness will be a challenge on limited budgets.</li></ul><h2>Status</h2><p>The API Commons initiative is currently not yet public - the plan is to present it at the Defrag Conference in early November which has kindly provided a keynote opportunity. In the meantime please do not share this activity publicly.</p>",

        "FAQ": "<h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Recent Judgements Indicate that APIs are not copyrightable - so why do we need a commons?</strong></p></p><p>The recent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_v._Google\">Oracle v's Google judgements</a> and others recently ruled against copyright being enforceable for API Interface definitions. However, we believe a commons is still critical for three reasons:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Such judgements may be reversed in the future and hence endanger many interfaces built on the premise of re-usability.</li><li>Legal processes are lengthy and costly - not having explicit agreement that re-use is permitted creates unknown business risks.</li><li>Even if re-use is permitted, it is common courtesy to seek permission to use someone else's work<li>Interface commons provides the means for interface owners to explicitly declare re-usability and hence remove any ambiguity.</li></ul><p><strong>Why not just use creative commons?</strong></p><p>Creative commons is a direct inspiration for API commons - and indeed people are encouraged to declare materials Creative Commons where possible. In the long run if API commons grows and there is interest we would certainly seek to link or even transition API Commons to Creative Commons.</p><p>However, in the short term having a separate name and process allows us to address the specific challenges of copyrighted interface code which is providing for explicit:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Listing of this type of content.</li><li>Tracking versioning.</li><li>Tracking usage and adoption.</li><li>Tracking contributions in a explicit way.</li><li>Supporting the conversation on how to best componentise and use such interfaces.</li></ul><p><strong>Don't Hypermedia APIs solve this problem?</strong></p><p>One of the goals of Hypermedia APIs is to reduce the number of bespoke \"hard wired\" clients that need to be written for static APIs. They do this by giving clients the capability to \"explore\" changes in an API at execution time. This is valuable and may indeed reduce the amount of client code which needs to be written in the long run. However in the short and mid term:</p><ul class=\"mainlist\"><li>Hypermedia APIs are a small fraction of all APIs being published.</li><li>They too suffer from the legal grey area of whether or not re-use is permitted - in other words, copyright may be enforced at any time.</li><li>Some of the APIs shared in the commons may indeed be hypermedia APIs - being in the commons will hopefully permit wider take up, evolution, creation of client code etc.</li></ul><p><strong>How is this different to <a href=\"http://www.schema.org/\">Schema.org</a>?</strong></p><p>Schema.org is an awesome project and resource and while there is a small amount of potential overlap API Commons has a different purpose. Schema.org mostly focuses primarily on micro-formats embedded in human readable web-pages - API Commons is for any type of API Interface definition. Also, Schema.org is a curated resource (and this is the correct choice since webmasters and crawlers rely on it to be consistent), API Commons however is intentionally \"bottom up\" such that anybody anywhere can declare something to be in the commons without a central authority.</p><p><strong>Why are you using Creative Commons and Not Open Source?</strong></p><p>This is something for ongoing discussion and could be changed. However for the moment it seems clear that API definitions could in some cases fall under copyright - hence the Creative Commons choice.</p><p><strong>Which Creative Commons License are you advocating?</strong></p><p>There are multiple Creative Commons licenses depending on what the copyright holder would like the achieve. In principle any Creative Commons license would make an API Description part of the commons - however we strongly encourage allowance for commercial reuse either as <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\">(Commercial) Attribution Share and Share Alike</a> or <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US\">(Commercial) Attribution</a></p>",
