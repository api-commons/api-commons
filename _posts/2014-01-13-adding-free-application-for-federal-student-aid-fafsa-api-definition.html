     We are adding the <a href="https://raw2.github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api/master/Applications">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) API swagger definition</a> to the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons</a> today.
</p>
<p>
     The <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">FAFSA API is a working project to show the Department of Education what is possible</a> when you turn a form into an API, with a goal of stimulating development of custom PDF implementations, as well as web and mobile application tools that use the API.
</p>
<p>
     The FAFSA API is not an official federal government project, but reflects a public / private sector partnership, showing was is done with the private sector and government work together to design APIs and to develop open source tooling around these APIs.
</p>
<p>
