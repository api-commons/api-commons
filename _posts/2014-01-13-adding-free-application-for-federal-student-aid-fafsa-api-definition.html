<p>We are adding the <a href="https://raw2.github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api/master/Applications">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) API swagger definition</a> to the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons</a> today.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">FAFSA API is a working project to show the Department of Education what is possible</a> when you turn a form into an API, with a goal of stimulating development of custom PDF implementations, as well as web and mobile application tools that use the API.</p>
<p>The FAFSA API is not an official federal government project, but reflects a public / private sector partnership, showing was is done with the private sector and government work together to design APIs and to develop open source tooling around these APIs.</p>
<p>You can participate in the FAFSA API development via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api">Github repository</a> and supporting <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">research Gitub page</a>.</p>
