<h2>Fixing The Machine Readability in API Commons</h2>

     When I first published 11 simple API definitions, I had developed using <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, into the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, I made a mistake when I referenced the Swagger specifications for each of the APIs. I linked to the machine readable Swagger spec, but not the raw JSON stored on Github, errorneously I linked directly to the Github page.
</p>
<p>
     I want the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-commons/api-commons/gh-pages/data/apis.json">machine readable API datastore</a>, at API Commons, which is used to drive the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API listing page</a>, to be completely machine readable, referencing all APIs, their machine readable API Commons manifest, as well as machine readable API definition. As the smart folks over at <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a> pointed out to me, I had been flip-flopping on this. Some of my later entries were machine readable pointers, but my earlier entries were not.
</p>
<p>
     Now all of the entries in the commons, have machine readable references to both their API Commons manifest, and API definition. I've also added a “<a href="http://apicommons.org/format.html">format</a>” page, to explain each of the fields, in the the API Commons manifest format, to help API providers better understand, and not make the same mistake I made.
</p>
<p>
     The API Commons manifest is meant to be a standalone, machine readable pointer to an APIs central truth (a machine readable API definition), and associated CC-BY-SA or CC0 licensing, and now, I think we have achieved our original goals around making this happen.
