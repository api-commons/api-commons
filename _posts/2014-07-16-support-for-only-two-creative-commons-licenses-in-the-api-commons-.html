<p>When we first conceived <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, we were a little fuzzy about which of Creative Commons licenses API providers should apply to their API definitions. As long as a provider took a stance on API copyright around your API definitions, applied a Creative Commons license, we considered an API &ldquo;in the commons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As time has evolved, and we've had time to reflect on the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">decision that the Federal Circuit Court handed down in the Oracle v Google case</a>, we've adjusted our vision of what Creative Commons licenses should &nbsp;be applied to an API, and still be considered as part of the "API Commons".</p>
<p>Moving forward the API Commons will accept two types of Creative Commons license:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a></strong> - At a minimum we want API designers to be recognized for their work, and other designers to recognize original authorship when relevant.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a></strong> - Ideally all API designers put their API definitions into the public domain, and wave all their copyright around API designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel pretty strongly that API definitions have to remain openly licensed, re-usable, even for commercial purposes. In a perfect world we wouldn't have to apply copyright at all, but in light of the Oracle v Google case we should take a proactive stance, and apply the copyright license that make the most sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> acknowledges the rights of API designers to recognized for their works, but strongly believe that for the API economy to grow and flourish, API definitions have to be re-usable, shareable and interoperable&mdash;publish your APIs into the API Commons today.</p>
