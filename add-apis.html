        <h2>Add API</h2>
        <p>
            There are several ways you can submit your API definition or data model to the API commons. We want to make adding your API as easy as possible, no matter where your API definition is located.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adding your API starts with generating an API Commons manifest for your API definition(s):
        </p><script src='https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7322203.js'></script>
        <p>
            If your manifest is on github, and contains the term api-commons-manifest, it will automatically be indexed and included in API commons daily.
        </p>
        You can also tweet the URL of your manifest with the hashtag #apicommonsmanifest or email to <a href='mailto:apicommons@gmail.com'>apicommons@gmail.com</a> and we will include in the commons.</p>
